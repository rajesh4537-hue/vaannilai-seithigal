## Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: User Icon Not Visible**
**Symptoms:** Can't find user icon in header
**Solution:** 
- Try refreshing the page (F5 or pull down on mobile)
- Clear browser cache
- Try different browser

### **Issue 2: Dropdown Doesn't Open**
**Symptoms:** User icon visible but clicking doesn't show menu
**Solution:**
- Make sure JavaScript is enabled
- Try clicking directly on the icon (not around it)
- Check if there are browser console errors

### **Issue 3: Settings Modal Doesn't Open**
**Symptoms:** Dropdown appears but clicking Settings/My Locations does nothing
**Solution:**
- Clear browser localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
- Refresh the page
- Try again

### **Issue 4: Can't Add Locations**
**Symptoms:** Settings opens but Add Location doesn't work
**Solution:**
- Make sure you're typing exact Tamil Nadu city names
- Try these test cities: Chennai, Madurai, Coimbatore, Salem, Trichy
- Check if autocomplete dropdown appears

## Manual Testing Commands

If you're comfortable with browser developer tools:

### **Open Browser Console** (F12 ‚Üí Console tab):

```javascript
// Check if settings are saved
console.log("My Locations:", localStorage.getItem('myLocations'));
console.log("Alert Settings:", localStorage.getItem('alertSettings'));

// Reset settings to default
localStorage.removeItem('myLocations');
localStorage.removeItem('alertSettings');
console.log("Settings cleared - refresh page");

// Manually add test location
localStorage.setItem('myLocations', '["Chennai", "Madurai"]');
console.log("Test locations added - refresh page");
```

## Expected Behavior

### **Working My Locations:**
- Can add Tamil Nadu cities from searchable dropdown
- Locations saved automatically (persist after page refresh)
- Can click saved location to switch weather view
- Can remove locations with trash icon

### **Working Weather Alerts:**
- 4 toggle switches for different alert types:
  - General Weather Alerts (blue toggle)
  - Severe Weather Alerts (orange toggle)  
  - Rain Alerts (blue toggle)
  - Temperature Alerts (red toggle)
- Toggles save automatically
- Settings persist after page refresh

## Device-Specific Notes

### **Desktop/Laptop:**
- User icon always visible in top-right
- Header navigation visible (Current Weather, Hourly, Daily, etc.)
- Full settings modal experience

### **Mobile:**
- User icon in top-right (smaller but visible)
- Header navigation hidden (only bottom tabs visible)
- Settings modal takes full screen

## What to Report

document.querySelector('[data-testid="settings-modal"]')?.style.display = 'block';

// Check if React component is loaded
console.log("React components loaded:", !!window.React);

// Check for JavaScript errors
console.log("Check above for any red error messages");
```
