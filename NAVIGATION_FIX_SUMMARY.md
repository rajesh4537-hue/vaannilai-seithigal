# 🎉 Navigation Issues Fixed - Tamil Nadu Weather App

## ✅ **ISSUES RESOLVED**

### **Problem:** Tab navigation not working properly
- Hourly, Daily, Radar, MinuteCast tabs weren't switching content
- Header navigation links were static (non-functional)
- All tabs showed the same Current Weather content

### **Root Cause:** 
1. Header component had static `<a href="#"` links that didn't communicate with main app
2. Missing tab content for Radar and MinuteCast tabs
3. Header component wasn't receiving `activeTab` and `onTabChange` props

### **Solution Implemented:**
1. **Updated Header Component** (`/app/frontend/src/components/Header.js`):
   - Converted static links to interactive buttons
   - Added `activeTab` and `onTabChange` props
   - Added proper visual indicators (blue highlight + underline) for active tabs

2. **Updated HomePage Component** (`/app/frontend/src/pages/HomePage.js`):
   - Passed `activeTab` and `setActiveTab` to Header component
   - Added complete Radar tab content with interactive radar display
   - Added complete MinuteCast tab content with precipitation charts

3. **Enhanced Tab Content:**
   - **Radar Tab**: Interactive Weather Radar for Tamil Nadu with visual elements
   - **MinuteCast Tab**: Precipitation intensity charts and 24-hour forecast
   - **Hourly/Daily Tabs**: Now properly display their respective forecast data
